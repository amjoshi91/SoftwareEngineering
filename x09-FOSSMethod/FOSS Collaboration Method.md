In FOSS, the owners of the project typically define the initial requirements of the project so that there is a starting point for developers and contributors to work on. The process that we think that a FOSS should have is Agile in Waterfall.

# Project Lifecycle

* Requirements
This is defined initially by the owners of the project. Generally people will get-together physically or over some collaborative channel to brainstorm the requirements. The requirements should also have issues pre-defined for contributors to get assigned on.

* Open Project for Contribution
The project is then opened to contributors with the idea and the list of issues.

This is where the iterative method starts and contributors submit pull requests and testing and merging happens.
- Submit a pull request
- Update documentation for the new feature
- Review and Test
- Merge
- If issues arise - create a new issue in the issues page
	
* Compiling the entire software

* Feedback from global users

# Philosophy:

* Have more conversations (possibly on Slack/Base Camp)
* Encourage contributors to make changes (if necessary)
* No contributor should be treated as an expert or a novice. All contributors at the same level
* Contribution guide should not be very strict and should have minimum requirements
